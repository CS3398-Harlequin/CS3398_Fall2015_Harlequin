Sprint 2 Breakdown (aka Sprint 1)
During this sprint I mainly familiarized myself with Python and the sentiment analyze program since I had 
no prior experience with either. I also started looking into using Django with python.

Sprint 3 Breakdown (aka Sprint 2)	
For the second sprint I mainly concentrated on figuring out how to use Django with python through videos 
and trying different examples.

In the end I was unsuccessful at getting a working webpage with Django so we ended up using a similar program 
known as Flask.
